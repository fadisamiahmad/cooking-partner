# Cooking Partner

This a project that let you save food recipes, and let you save shopping list with preview images.
I used Angular 8 for front end, Node.js for backend and MangoDB as a database.

In this project there:

- Routing between different pages
- Created forms that captures users data
- Created service for http requests
- Created custom Pipes, Directives
- Managed Authentication and Route protection
